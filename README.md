# gaussAlgorithm
A very short program to reduce matrixes 2x3 and 3x4

At the beginning my goal was to create a program able to reduce all the matrixes, then I found out that I would had need to use new libraries, so
I reduced my expectations since it was something that I wanted to do just to spend at top 2 hours;
So here the program.

I'm open to any suggestions to improve the code.
Bye
